# 💡 Emerging Trends in Software Development  

A Data-Driven Exploration of Technology Preferences and Career Insights

This project analyzes developer preferences, technology usage, and career priorities using survey data from Stack Overflow, GitHub Jobs, and other sources. It combines Python-based data analysis with IBM Cognos dashboards to uncover trends in programming languages, databases, platforms, and job factors.

---

## ✨ Features  
- Cleaned and transformed survey data for analysis  
- Interactive dashboards built in IBM Cognos  
- Visualizations of current and future tech preferences  
- Insights into developer demographics and job motivations  
- Comparative analysis of salaries and job postings by language  
- GitHub-ready structure for showcasing as a portfolio project

## 🔍 Insights

- **Web technologies dominate**: JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Python lead both usage and desirability.
- **Simplicity matters**: Languages with clean syntax and strong typing (e.g., TypeScript, Go) are gaining traction.
- **NoSQL rising**: MongoDB, Redis, and Firebase show increasing interest compared to traditional SQL databases.
- **Developers prioritize tools**: The most important job factor is the technologies used on the job.
- **Youth-driven innovation**: Most respondents are aged 22–32, driving demand for modern, flexible tools.
- **English-centric ecosystem**: The dominance of English-speaking countries shapes language and platform preferences.
